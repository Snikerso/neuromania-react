                        Welcome to the first international edition of the Neuromania Conference.
    
    
                        Have you ever wondered what visual imagery is? We did, it seems that the capacity to imagine varies greatly between individuals (Crawford WInlove). But wait... What about  imagining in different modalities? How do blind people imagine? How do blind people think abstractly? (Roberto Bottini) Speaking of which, what actually might “thinking” be? Evidence suggest that the structure of the semantic representation is spatial (geometrical) (Peter Gärdenfors). Furthermore, the research on the attentional mechanisms also point to the spatial, supramodal representation of space (Rob van der Lubbe). Recently, it has been proposed that the grid cells system in entorhinal cortex can serve a role of navigating through the cognitive spaces (Jacob Bellmund).
                        Taken together, these seemingly unconnected ideas start to work together, bringing us to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying higher cognitive skills. At the conference we are going to explore these topics and get a better grip on the complex relationships between imagination, abstract thinking and spatial cognition.
    
                        Each of the mentioned specialists will give a lecture related to his field of expertise and in the first day’s afternoon we will have an open debate moderated by another expert in the field (Rafał Czajkowski).
    
                        At this conference we ask big questions and look for the answers with experts from different fields. Why? Cause we're curious and truly interdisciplinary!
    
                        On behalf of organising committee,
